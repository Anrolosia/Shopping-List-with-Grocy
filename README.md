## ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced Configuration**

### Shopping Suggestions Algorithm Tuning

The shopping suggestions feature includes advanced configuration options for fine-tuning the prediction algorithm. Access these through the integration configuration page:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** These settings control the core algorithm. Incorrect values may break the suggestions feature. We recommend leaving defaults unchanged unless you fully understand the algorithm.

**Algorithm Weights** (must sum to 1.0):
- **Consumption Weight** (default: 0.4) - How much consumption rate affects suggestions
- **Frequency Weight** (default: 0.5) - How much purchase frequency affects suggestions  
- **Seasonal Weight** (default: 0.1) - How much seasonal patterns affect suggestions

**Threshold Settings:**
- **Score Threshold** (default: 0.3) - Minimum confidence score for suggestions (0.0-1.0)

**Example Advanced Configuration:**
```yaml
# For users who prefer frequency-based suggestions
consumption_weight: 0.3
frequency_weight: 0.5
seasonal_weight: 0.2
score_threshold: 0.65

# For seasonal shoppers
consumption_weight: 0.3
frequency_weight: 0.3
seasonal_weight: 0.4
score_threshold: 0.55
```

## Custom Product UserFields üìù

You can add custom fields to your products in Grocy and use them in Home Assistant. Example: Create a **Custom Sort** field in Grocy:

```yaml
Entity: products
Name: customsort
Caption: Custom Sort
Type: Number(decimal)
Show as column in tables: checked
```

Then modify your dashboard to sort using this field:

```yaml
sort:
  method: attribute
  attribute: userfields:customsort
  numeric: true
```

## Troubleshooting & FAQ ‚ùì

### Shopping Suggestions

**Q: Why am I seeing "Analysis in progress..." for a long time?**
A: The analysis requires sufficient purchase history data. Ensure you have several months of purchase data in Grocy for accurate predictions.

**Q: My suggestions seem inaccurate. How can I improve them?**
A: Try adjusting the algorithm weights in the advanced configuration. Increase the consumption weight if you want more consumption-based suggestions, or increase frequency weight for frequency-based predictions.

**Q: How often do suggestions update?**
A: Suggestions automatically reset after 1 hour to ensure freshness. You can also manually reset them using the reset service.

**Q: Can I disable the auto-reset feature?**
A: The auto-reset is built-in for optimal user experience, but you can manually generate new suggestions at any time using the suggest service.

**Q: The frontend panel shows "No analysis available"**
A: This appears when no suggestions have been generated yet or after a reset. Run the `suggest_grocery_list` service to generate new suggestions.

### General Troubleshooting

**Q: Integration not loading?**
A: Ensure your Grocy URL and API key are correct. Check the Home Assistant logs for detailed error messages.

**Q: To-Do lists not syncing?**
A: Verify that your Grocy shopping lists are accessible via the API and that the integration has proper permissions.
